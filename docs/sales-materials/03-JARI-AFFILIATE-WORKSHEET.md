## QUICK SCRIPTS

### Opening Line
> *"Tell me about your business - what do you sell and how do customers find you?"*

### Pain Discovery
> *"Walk me through what happens when someone wants to buy..."*

### The Pitch
> *"Jari gives you a professional store where customers see products, pay M-Pesa automatically, and you just fulfill. 10 minutes to set up, 1,200 bob a month."*

### Objection: "Too expensive"
> *"How many sales do you lose to slow responses? One recovered sale covers the month."*

### Objection: "I'll think about it"
> *"What specifically - price, fit, or something else?"*

### Close
> *"Should we get you started today?"*
