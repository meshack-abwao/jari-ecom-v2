- M-Pesa payment integration
- A dashboard to track orders
- Shareable links for social media

## WHO IS JARI FOR?

### ✅ Perfect Fit (Hot Leads)

| Signal | What They Say |
|--------|---------------|
| Frustrated with DMs | *"I lose customers because I can't respond fast enough"* |
| Manual payments | *"I tell them to send M-Pesa then screenshot"* |
| No professional store | *"I just use Instagram/WhatsApp, no website"* |
| Growing but chaotic | *"I'm getting orders but can't track anything"* |
| Wants to look legit | *"Customers ask if I have a website"* |

### ❌ Not Ready (Cold/Wrong Fit)

| Signal | Why Not Now |
|--------|-------------|
| No products yet | Need products first |
| Already has Shopify/WooCommerce | Different solution |
| Not selling on social | Jari is for social sellers |
| Just browsing | No urgency |

---

## THE JARI PITCH (30 Seconds)

> *"You know how you spend hours replying DMs, telling customers to M-Pesa you, then checking if payment came through? Jari gives you a professional store where customers see your products, pay via M-Pesa automatically, and you just fulfill orders. You can set it up in 10 minutes and it costs less than what you'd pay a developer - starting at 1,200 bob a month."*

---

## DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (JTBD Approach)

**Don't pitch immediately.** Ask questions to understand their JOB:

### Opening
> *"Tell me about your business - what do you sell and how do customers usually find you?"*

### Pain Discovery
> *"Walk me through what happens when someone wants to buy from you..."*

**Listen for:**
- Manual DM conversations
- Payment confirmation hassles
- Lost sales / slow responses
- No way to track what's working

### Urgency Check
> *"How many sales do you think you lose because of this process?"*

> *"What would it mean for your business if every interested customer could pay in 30 seconds?"*

---

## MATCHING JARI TO THEIR JOB

Based on their answers, recommend the right theme:

| If They Sell... | Recommend Theme | Key Benefit |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Clothes, accessories, gadgets | **Quick Sell** | *"Customers browse, tap, pay - 30 seconds"* |
| Cakes, food, meals | **Visual Menu** | *"Beautiful menu, order like Uber Eats"* |
| Premium/custom items | **Deep Dive** | *"Tell your story, justify your price"* |
| Classes, appointments | **Events/Booking** | *"Pick slot and pay - no back-and-forth"* |
| Coaching, consulting | **Services** | *"Explain packages, let them book"* |

---

## HANDLING OBJECTIONS

### "It's too expensive"
> *"I hear you. Let me ask - how much time do you spend on DMs and payment follow-ups each day? Even 2 hours a day is 60 hours a month. At 1,200 bob, Jari costs less than your time. Plus, how many sales do you lose when you can't respond fast? One recovered sale probably covers the whole month."*

### "I'll think about it"
> *"Totally understand. Quick question - what specifically do you want to think about? Is it the price, whether it'll work for your products, or something else?"*

### "I don't have time to set it up"
> *"That's actually why Jari exists - it takes 10 minutes. You answer a few questions, upload your products, and you're live. Want me to show you right now?"*

### "My customers are used to DMs"
> *"And they'll still DM you! But now you can send them a link that lets them see everything, pick what they want, and pay instantly. You close sales faster, they get a better experience."*

### "I tried something like this before"
> *"What happened with that? ... Jari is built specifically for Instagram and WhatsApp sellers in Kenya - M-Pesa is built in, not an afterthought. What you tried before probably wasn't designed for how you actually sell."*
